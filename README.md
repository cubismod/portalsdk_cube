Portal SDK Launcher (community tool)
==============

The PortalSDK_Installer.exe file in the "exes" folder will install the tool correctly so it can be pinned to your taskbar, added to Steam, etc. Enjoy!

A third-party launcher for Portal mods.

With the recent removal of the Source SDK launcher by Valve, I made one that works with Portal. 

If you've got Multimedia Fusion 2, you can tinker around with the mfa files in the src directory.
