portalsdk_cube
==============

A third-party launcher for Portal mods.

With the recent removal of the Source SDK launcher by Valve, I made one that works with Portal. The PortalSDK_Installer.exe file will install the tool correctly so it can be pinned to your taskbar, added to Steam, etc. Enjoy!

If you've got multimedia fusion, you can tinker around with the source files in the src directory.
